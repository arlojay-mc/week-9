""" M. Bock 9/26/2019 Dictionary Sample Program â€“ this program is very similar to the lab.
As you adapt it to the new content, you will have to add a new feature "edit" to change an existing entry.
Edit has to be added to the menus, and a function has to be added and called. In addition,
note the program features that change case of strings.
You may have to adapt this code to fit capitalization of your new program. """
